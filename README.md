A Rencting bicycles project 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The App idea is based on a personal experience with “Lemon Tour” which is a company providing renting bicycles service in Tunisia.
We aimed to digitize the service and add some features as Google Map, Music playlist, etc..
